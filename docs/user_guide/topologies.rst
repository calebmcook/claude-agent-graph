Graph Topologies
================

Guide to different graph structures and when to use them.

.. note::
   This section is under development. See :doc:`concepts` for basic topology information.

Supported Topologies
--------------------

* **Tree**: Hierarchical structures
* **DAG**: Directed acyclic workflows
* **Chain**: Sequential processing
* **Star**: Hub-and-spoke patterns
* **Mesh**: Collaborative networks
* **Cycle**: Iterative processes

For now, see the examples directory for topology demonstrations.
